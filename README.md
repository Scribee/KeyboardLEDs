Arduino sketch that controls an LED strip based on MIDI data from a keyboard.

When a key is pressed, the nearest LED to it lights up, then turns off when the key is released.

_The current version is technically functional, but occasionally still has issues with LEDs staying lit after many keys are released at once_


The main inspiration for this project was piano youtuber [Rousseau](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPZUQqtVDmcjm4NY5FkzqLA), who has an awesome piano that does this on its own.
